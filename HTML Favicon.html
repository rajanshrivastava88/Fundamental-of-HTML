    <h3>A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.</h3>

        How To Add a Favicon in HTML
        You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites
        like https://www.favicon.cc.

        Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.

        A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

        To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or
        create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name
        for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

        Next, add a
        <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:


    </p>

</body>

</html>


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>My Page Title</title>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>

<body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    Now, save the "index.html" file and reload it in your browser. Your browser tab should now display
    your favicon image to the left of the page title.
